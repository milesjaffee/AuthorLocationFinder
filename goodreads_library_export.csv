It's one of the trippiest things I've ever read, and a the prose is world apart from anything you'd ever find in a more conventional book (especially anything written by a MFA!!). It's a lot like microtonal music, in that way - overlooked by the establishment, but supremely refreshing and exciting in a way I'd forgotten this medium could be.<br/><br/>This is the third Nost book I've actually read (I gave it a once-over a couple years ago, but didn't understand anything), and it cements his place in my mind as one of the most exciting, underrated authors of the past decade. It bears a lot of similarities to the later <i>Almost Nowhere</i>, including some of the imagery (among other familiar things, the idea of a branching timeline being integrated Github-style into the alpha timeline seems to have been reused in its entirety), but it's snappier, less sprawling, a lot more concise. It's no surprise the author works in cybersecurity - only a STEM brain could find this stuff exciting (I mean this as a compliment...)<br/><br/>Influences are taken from other mediums (I recognized a few scenes with Kyle that seemed to be lifted straight out of Neon Genesis Evangelion), but integrated so smoothly into prose. From the opening lines to the eye-popping final scene (which I can only compare to the last song on Unwound's ""Leaves Turn Inside You""), everything fits into a surreal yet philosophically cohesive framework. <br/><br/>It can be messy, confusing, directionless, but thrillingly so - more of a ""what's happening now??",,,1,0

Hedged between giving it three or four stars. Lionel is a unique narrator - you start to (or at least I started to) feel bad for the guy, while at the same time wanting nothing but to read more of his complicated misadventures. Such a weird head to be in. I lowkey felt like the descriptions of his tics were substantially influencing me to be more twitchy. My version of his head-tilt worry thing is twirling/tugging at my hair, a habit I think I got from my dad, who is now mostly bald - bright tidings ahead. EATMEBAILEY!<br/><br/>The plot is basically an excuse to bring out different weird Lionel Reactions(tm). It doesn't fully explore the full implications of what would be the plot if this were a normal detective story, but it definitely explores all the corners of his head, which is the real premise. I did think the last few dozen pages barely tied off, let alone resolved, the pressure that had been building the entire book in both realms, even if the classic detective ending was kind of nice.<br/><br/>",,,1,0

At the same time, the various romance subplots and epic action scenes are quite well done for their genres and show clear respect for the greats, also rare for a nerdier book, where they're often last-minute cast-offs. It toes the line between James Patterson and Wittgenstein. All the segment power-word stuff is explained in this highly intellectual way that's interesting in its own right, and then you're still not prepared to see it all used in the field...<br/>I also liked Wil - similar to Harry from Disco Elysium and Grant from my beloved Almost Nowhere, it's fun to see all the worldbuilding through the eyes of the clueless patsy (actually, I could make *a lot* of parallels with either of those characters/settings). Emily was also super interesting - it was fun to be in her head.",,,1,0

It's clearly written by the same person as TNC, but takes its rambling surrealism in a totally different direction (I'd say it improves on it, at least at first). To be brief, it's an insanely high-concept setting, yet with well-written, complex, and ironically very human characters we get to know on a deeply personal, intimate level. <br/><br/>Self-important made-up terms are introduced, as in hard sci-fi (bilaterals, crashes, sign-trains; later, rebases, kosmopoesis, and the titular Almost-Nowhere), but they're always introduced as mystery words, turning characteristic, likable prose into more-than-real surrealistic poetry suffused with gooey foreshadowing, as in a memorable moment in chapter 6 when Hector praises bilaterals' ability to do something that's only really explained in a much later chapter while listening to ""Damian Marley's sign-train blaring."" <br/><br/>It's a mystery set in a world where you don't even understand the laws reality operates by, a drama intersticed with quantum physics lectures. Its prose - influenced half by technical, hard sci-fi and half by poetry (as in a particularly memorable chapter towards the end where a long bout of exposition about how multiple timelines ""really"" work turns eye-poppingly into a dark, surrealistic, desperate stream-of-consciousness screed) is flowery enough to make me even consider using words like fucking ""intersticed"" to describe it, yet that proves to be one of its greatest strengths, creating a grandeur and genuine self-importance that's very rare among modern books. <br/><br/>It really explores every crumb of meaning it can wring out of the premise. The anonymous author has said at some point that he writes outlines for chapters like a fanfic author theorizing what might happen next, and at some other point that he feels like he only ""channels"" his works rather than actually ""writing"" them. Accordingly, there's a fundamental love of the setting and characters, but also a willingness to completely change the stakes on them.<br/><br/>VAGUE SPOILERS BELOW<br/><br/>The second and third books are inferior to the first one, but the ""Act 6 Act 1""-esque beginning of the second is very clever, not to mention NOWHERE TO HIDE. The mysteries keep getting set up well. The third is just alright, and I mostly kept reading out of an obligation of seeing what happened to the characters, although the bit with the singing and the beasts was just beautiful. I thought it tangled itself up too much and self-sabotaged with all that postmodern meta-goofery when it could have been more dignified without it.<br/><br/>I've been reading the 300k-word book on and off for months, and now my daily routine has an Almost Nowhere-shaped hole in it. I feel like the Anne who was deprived of her Ratleak. Well, I guess this guy does have two more books I haven't read...",,,1,0

Proficiently written prose is the only good thing going on here. <br/>It flails around for the first few hundred pages, only introduces the (frankly tired and lame) philosophical quandary it's supposedly all about like halfway through in a really forced, predictable way, and barely lets you know the characters or connect them together (I kind of liked Olive, but we don't get enough of her... and we get way too much of the non-entity Gaspery)<br/>Desperately wants to be Station Eleven with the multiple eras in contrast, but due to its own mechanics, has a really hard time doing the perversely Homestuck-esque narrative simultaniety tricks that make that book so great.<br/>All builds up to this big culminating scene that feels a little stupid and over-the-top rather than cool and revelatory as it could have been if it was set up better<br/>Worldbuilding is ass (well, I liked the midnight city, but we only got glimpses of it). Everything about the future here reveals an almost upsettingly shaky understanding of how the world/geopolitics/historiography works - which is bizarre when Station Eleven's ""20 years later"" was so visceral and real!<br/>The entire plot feels like an 'afterthought' to write all these cool settings/scenes/imagery, except it just all becomes about the afterthought characters you don't care about...<br/>",,,1,0
